# Financial Stability of African Countries between 1860 to 2014

This data science project uses data to analyze the financial stability of 13 African countries from 1860 to 2014. It also creates a supervised classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a country will get a systemic_crisis warning.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by Kaggle under the 'Systemic Crisis, Banking Crisis, inflation Crisis In Africa' (dataset link) [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fTQ9R29kgAhInFO0HMqvkcAfSZWg6fCx/view]. It has been derived from the original copy and simplified for learning purposes. 

## Objective & Goal
Thus, the objective is to build and train a Supervised Classification Machine Learning model to predict the systemic crisis warning of a particular country given a set of indicators like the annual inflation rates.
This project is ideal for data scientists enthusiasts and anyone interested in learning how to train and evaluate models.


## Steps to follow
* Import libraries
* Load dataset
* Data wrangling & exploration - statistical analysis, data cleaning, understanding, visualization, checking outliers etc
* Choosing the model
* Feature engineering & selection
* Handling outliers and standardizing our data (if needed)
* Training model
* Making predictions
* Evaluation of the model
* Improving the model
